# Pi Weather Station Software Package

This directory is tagged as a branch, to be cloned or copied into the weather stations Raspberry Pi OS. It contains the scripts for setup, upgrade and maintenance of weather station code and data. The weather station software is a mix of C programs and shell scripts. Data collection is using standard cron entries. RRD is used as the backend database.

## Directory Overview

weather-station/
 |
 +-- backup/ --> (empty) Used to store local configuration and data during software upgrades
 |
 +-- etc/ --> Contains the configuration template, which is the first file that needs to be edited.
 |
 +-- install/ -->Contains the scripts to create and upgrade the station software, or repair data.
 |
 +-- src/ --> Contains C source code for the station software. Compilation and install is done through setup.sh inside the install directory.
 |
 +-- web/ --> Contains the template files for the local website that runs on the weather station. The files are moved into place through setup.sh.

## Prerequisites

The weather stations Raspberry Pi's use Rasbian OS in the "lite" version, which fills the SD cards disk space to about 1.2 GB. The network should be configured for Internet access. The install process will get about 300 MB of additional required packages. The network connectivity can be either through Wifi or Ethernet, the weather station can work with either one.

Before I write the Rasbian OS image to SD card, I modify the image to add local network information, which lets me bring up the Pi into the local network and connect immediately at first boot. For modification, I mount the stock image file from a Linux VM as follows:

- Mount the Linux partition by calculating its offset

```
root@linvm:~ # mount 2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie-lite.img -o loop,offset=$((512 * 92160)) /mnt
root@linvm:~ # ls /mnt/
```

- Update network and other configuration files

```
vi /mnt/etc/network/interfaces
vi /mnt/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
vi /mnt/etc/hosts
vi /mnt/etc/hostname
vi /mnt/etc/rsyslog.conf
vi /mnt/etc/modprobe.d/bcm2835_gpiomem.conf
ln -s /etc/init.d/ssh /etc/rc3.d/S02ssh
ln -s /etc/init.d/ssh /etc/rc5.d/S02ssh (or manually create a empty file called "ssh" in the boot partition of the SD card).
umount /mnt
```

Latest version of Rasbian was updated to Debian 9 Stretch, and works. It required only two package name updates (librrd4->librrd8, php5-cgi->php-cgi).

## Software Installation

After first boot, run raspi-config to enable the I2C-bus and camera, configure timezone. Download the weather-station SW package (git or manual .gtgz package download).

First, create or update the configuration file `pi-weather.conf` in the `etc` directory. The following settings are minimum to be configured:

- *pi-weather-sid* --> Station ID that must be unique to each station. The value is used to set the hostname, and for data uploads to the centralized Internet website. The schema is pi-wsXX. XX is a two-digit number that is simply counted up.

- *pi-weather-lat* --> GPS latitude of the weather stations location. Value needs to be in decimal format.

- *pi-weather-lon* --> GPS longitude of the weather stations location. Decimal format.

- *pi-weather-tzs* --> Weather stations timezone setting (match entry in /usr/share/zoneinfo).

- *sensor-type=bme280* --> One of the supported sensor types.
*sensor-addr=0x76* --> The sensors I2C address.

Next, change directory into the `install` folder, and execute the script `setup.sh`. The script should run tests to confirm the sensor function. It creates the weather stations work directory named after the station ID, e.g. `pi-ws01`, containing the binaries and data directories.

## Local Station Operation

After completion, reboot the Pi. The weather station software installed a local web service (Lightttp) that allows pointing a browser to the stations IP address. The cron jobs should start collecting sensor data filling the RRD, and taking camera pictures in 1 minute intervals. Any issues can be investigated by looking at the files in `var` and `log` directories.

- Check the sensor data file existence and timestamp

```
pi@pi-ws01:~ $ ls -l pi-ws01/var/sensor.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 61 Oct 29 11:54 pi-ws01/var/sensor.txt
```

- Check the sensor data content

```
pi@pi-ws01:~ $ cat pi-ws01/var/sensor.txt
1509245646 Temp=14.83*C Humidity=91.26% Pressure=100555.85Pa
```

- Check the RRD database update log

```

## Integration with the Internet-based Web Server

The weather station is typically part of a private (home) network that allows only outbound Internet access. To access the weather stations data remotely, the station can be set to send its sensor and camera data to the central Internet web server (e.g. http://weather.fm4dd.com). The script `send-setup.sh` in the `install` directory collects the necessary information and copies it into the Internet server.

After the Internet web server has been set up, the sensor data is feed to Internet web server in parallel to the local RRD database updates. To compensate for temporary local network outages, a daily transmission sends the full RRD database to the Internet server. 

Because RRD databases are CPU-specific, they can't be copied from a Raspi (ARM) to an Intel environment. For RRD database mgrations, the `rrdtool dump` command creates a XML extract that can be restored to different platforms. For manal DB transmission, below commands serve as an example:

- Raspi side

```
pi@pi-ws01:~ $ rrdtool dump /home/pi/sensor/rrd/weather.rrd > weather.xml
pi@pi-ws01:~ $ scp weather.xml user@weather.fm4dd.com:~
```

- Internet server side

```
ws01@weatherweb:~ $ rrdtool restore /home/ws01/weather.xml pi-ws01.rrd
```

## Optional Hardware Setup

The script `rtcenable.sh` can enable an optional battery-buffered real-time clock module. The RTC is helpful for weather stations without permanent Internet access. If they are unable to sync their time from the net, they are at risk of running wrong system time, which in turn could break the sensor data collection.

## Sensor Failures and Recovery

Due to age or sever weather conditions, sensors break down after some time. Instead of just stopping operations, they often start to send wrong data readings. It is not uncommon to see -2 temperature, 500000 Pa pressure or 100% humidity in such circumstances. While the weather station has a "outlier" function to identify and eliminate sporadic, single miss-reads, the continous reporting of false data from a broken sensor is harder to handle. After fixing the sensor hardware, database cleanup is done to eradicate the erroneous longterm data which take hold in the MIN/MAX aggregations. With the database type being RRD, there is no easy way to edit or update individual entries.

### rrdrepair.sh

The script `rrdrepair.sh` was created to help with database cleanup in between current data updates. It exports the RRD content into XML, which is then updated by a prepared vi source file before being re-imported into RRD. Due to the RRD size, XML line count is quite high, which slows down vi's line matching. Ideally the RRD repair process is done in between the 1-minute data readings to prevent loss of a reading. `rrdrepair.sh` therefore catches the moment right after the latest file update to maximise the time window.

### wsreplace.sh

The script `wsreplace.sh` automates the transfer of the weather station work directory and other necessary data to a second station in order to let it take over the function of the first. This allows for a quick swap of a complete weather station for repairs or upgrades. Before, this swap needed too much time for extracting the old stations micro SD card.
